                    <h2>Designing experience in B2B segment</h2>

                    <p>Users behave and think differently whether it is B2B or B2C segment. The key difference is how users make decisions: in B2C the nature of decisions is mostly impulsive and short-term, meanwhile for B2B decisions have long-term implications. Keeping this in mind, I had to discover what will be the best practices for my specific B2B user group. Only after multiple research iterations I was able to see a bigger picture of how users interact with my product. The experience map which I obtained from research findings highlighted how important to closely collaborate with other departments in my company who interconnect with the user from the very beginning to the end of sales funnel (sales managers and customer service specialists). Now I always take into consideration the significance of delivering consistent experience across all stages of customer journey when exploring design decisions.</p>

                            Data driven design approach puts design process on another level. Design decisions I made that relied on numerical data showed the impact of design changes and further facilitated getting attention from stakeholders on critical problems.

                            Jobs to be done (JTBD) sometimes can be more effective than traditional user personas when trying to understand the patterns of user behavior.

                            Insights obtained from quantitive research should be supported (when possible in terms of time and money resources) with qualitative data to provide a better statistical significance. When I communicate with users and analyze their answers, there is always some room for misinterpretation of data or other factors involved. Thatâ€™s I try to reaffirm my conclusions by conducting complementary quantitative research.
